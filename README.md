# genius-urbandic-youtube

I built this app as I got sick from switching back and forth between Youtube and Genius.com.

>>>Test it here [https://intense-plains-4382.herokuapp.com/](https://intense-plains-4382.herokuapp.com/)

Oh and I might build a chrome extension for an immediate redirection in the futur so come back to my github as soon as you can ;)

@TODO: improving the search feature (it works only for limited examples)

@TODO: parsing the lyrics and binding the words/expressions with their urbandictionnary meaning
