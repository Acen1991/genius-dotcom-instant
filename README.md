# genius-urbandic-youtube

I built this app as I got sick from switching back and forth between Youtube and Genius.com.

    test it here [https://intense-plains-4382.herokuapp.com/](https://intense-plains-4382.herokuapp.com/)

It will allows you to find the genius lyrics of the youtube video clip you are watching and get a highlighted definition of terms and expressions form urban-dictionnary (a nice feature that I also waited for).

Oh and I might build a chrome extension for an immediate redirection in the futur so come back to my github ;)

@TODO: improving the search feature (it works only for limited simple examples)

@TODO: parsing the lyrics and binding the words/expressions with their urbandictionnary meaning
