# genius-instant

I built this app as I got sick from switching back and forth between Youtube and Genius.com.

>>>Test it here [https://genius-instant.herokuapp.com/](https://genius-instant.herokuapp.com/)

@TODO: improving the search feature to get the maximum right lyrics

@TODO: displaying genius annotations with a mouseover effect (else I wouldn't call it "genius-instant" :P)

@TODO: parsing the lyrics and binding the words/expressions with their urbandictionnary meaning

Oh and I might build a chrome extension for an immediate redirection in the futur so come back to my github as soon as you can ;)
